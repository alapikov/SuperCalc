# SuperCalc
First pet project. A simple webpage calculator inspired by material design.
I decided to choose a typical calculator as a basis for my first project, but to make it nice-looking and with some additional features. I instantly knew that it will be in style of material design, with selectible color palette and "powerful mode". I tried to achieve smooth and clean animations only with CSS, implement clear UI with the basic knowledge I had. Maybe I'll take time to improve code and add some other features in the future.
